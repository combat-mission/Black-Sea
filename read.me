All maps have been converted to Black Sea readable format. However, not all maps will actually load into Black Sea. 
Look for (BS compat) labeled maps if you want to be 100% sure a map will load in the game. You can obviously 
try to load any map and many will work out of the box but if it does not have that phrase it may crash.
